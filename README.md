# python_tdb

The python_tdb was a project to create a tournament organization site and database with an automatic Elo scoring system.
It was originally focused on organizing tournaments and running brackets, but I started building out the database portion
to help the various tournament cataloguing projects of the time and bring all of the ideas together.
